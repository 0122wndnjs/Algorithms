readme.txt for prerequisite.java

prerequisite.java is the file for listing classes with the prerequisites. To run
this code, first I made a run.sh file for the java. In run.sh file, I wrote
javac prerequisite.java to compile the java file, and java prerequisite $1 to
make it run. To use the run.sh file, on the command line, I have to write
chmod 700 run.sh. Lastly, I typed ./run.sh inputQ2.txt. Than it will create the
output.txt file. In the output file, the correct order of prerequisite classes
are listed.
