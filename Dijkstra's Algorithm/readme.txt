readme.txt for Dijkstra.java

Dijkstra.java is the file for finding the shortest path to every other vertex.
To run this code, first, I made a run.sh file for the java. In run.sh file, I wrote
javac Dijkstra.java to compile the java file, and java Dijkstra $1 to make it run.
To use the run.sh file, on the command line, I have to write chmod 700 run.sh.
Lastly, I typed ./run.sh input.txt. Than it will create the output.txt file.
In the output.txt file, the correct answer for shortest path length and the actual
path is written.
