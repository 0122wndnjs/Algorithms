readme.txt for AddVertEdge.java

AddVertEdge.java is the file for find an efficient way to find all pairs shortest paths
when new vertexes and edges are added for an undirected graph. To run this code, first, I
type on the command line, javac AddVertEdge.jag to compile the program. Than, I typed
java AddVertEdge to run the program. Similar as Johnson's Algorithm file, it will ask to
type the number of vertexes and than adjacency matrix.

For this class, I cannot really finish up. I tried to add method for adding vertexes and
edges but somehow it was not working well. And as similar as JohnonsAlgorithm.java, I had
problem creating the ouput.txt file so that I made a program to run manually. The output
might mismatch with the output that originally expect since I had some errors on that.
I just tried my best to figure out but it was hard to move to the code what I was thinking.
