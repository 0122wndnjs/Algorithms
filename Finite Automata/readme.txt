readme.txt for FiniteAuto.java

FiniteAuto.java is the file for finding string match by using the Finite Automata.
To run this cosde, first, I made a run.sh file for the java. In run.sh file, I wrote
javac FiniteAuto.java to compile toe java file, and java FiniteAuto $1 to make it run.
To use the run.sh file, on the command line, I have to write chmod 700 run.sh.
Lastly, I typed ./run.sh input.txt. Than it will create the output.txt file.
In the output, file, the correct answer for string matching is listed.
